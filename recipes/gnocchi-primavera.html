        <p>Potato gnocchi with wonderful crisp vegetables and basil make a delicious, rustic meal.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>half cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided.</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons pine nuts.</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package potato gnocchi.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided.</li>
            <li>1 zucchini, chopped.</li>
            <li>12 fresh mushrooms, cleaned and stems trimmed.</li>
            <li>12 grape tomatoes.</li>
            <li>10 torn fresh basil leaves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Spray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray, and place over medium-low heat. Place about 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese at a time into the skillet. Cook until cheese melts into a thin circle, begins to bubble, and browns at the edges, about 1 minute. Flip the crisp, and brown the other side for about 30 seconds. Remove the crisp to a plate to cool. Make 3 more cheese crisps the same way.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add pine nuts; cook and stir until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove pine nuts from the skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook gnocchi according to the package directions; drain them in a colander set in the sink.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add zucchini; cook and stir just until seared, about 2 minutes. Remove zucchini from the pan. Reduce heat to medium; add mushrooms and stir until they begin to give up their juices but are still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain the juices. Return zucchini to the pan; add tomatoes, torn basil leaves, toasted pine nuts, drained gnocchi, and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil; cook and stir until heated through.</li>
            <li>To serve, divide gnocchi among four plates, and serve each plate topped with a Parmesan cheese crisp.</li>
        </ol>
